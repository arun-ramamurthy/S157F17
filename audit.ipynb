    "Any way of tabulating votes can and will make mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we tell whether those mistakes are _material_, that is, whether they caused the outcome to be wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a trustworthy audit trail of paper ballots, we can check the electronic tally against a manual inspection of the paper. In principle we could recount all the votes by hand, but that's unnecessarily expensive.\n",
    "Statistical methods can be more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "What would we like an election audit to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, statutory election audits didn't really have much of a motivating principle.\n",
    "They were of the form \"audit X% of the precincts and report what you see.\"\n",
    "That doesn't give much of a guarantee of anything. In particular, depending on the margin,\n",
    "X% might not even be enough to have a reasonable chance of finding any errors whatsoever even if\n",
    "the reported outcome was wrong.\n",
    "Proponents of that kind of audit often claim that the purpose of the audit is to check whether the machines\n",
    "are working properly.\n",
    "But \"properly\" isn't a precise thing: because there is always some rate of error, especially in \n",
    "machine interpretation of manually marked ballots, the question is whether the machines worked\n",
    "\"well enough.\" They never work perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, the next approach to audits involved a \"detection\" paradigm, which is sensitive\n",
    "to the margin (it involves drawing larger samples to check smaller margins).\n",
    "In the detection approach, the goal is to draw a large enough sample that, \n",
    "if the reported outcome was wrong, there is\n",
    "a large chance that the sample will reveal at least one machine error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The detection paradigm is an improvement over the more arbitrary \"audit X%\" style of audit,\n",
    "but in my opinion, it doesn't answer the right question.\n",
    "In part, that's because machines inevitably misinterpret some fraction of hand-marked\n",
    "ballots, so an audit of a reasonable number of ballots is bound to find at least one machine error.\n",
    "What then?\n",
    "Such errors do not necessarily cast doubt on the outcome: the frequency of errors matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think a better question is, \"in light of the errors the audit found in the sample, how confident should we\n",
    "be that the reported outcome is correct?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Even that doesn't seem like enough to ask: ideally, we would like the audit to be a quality control measure\n",
    "that corrects errors if the errors matter.\n",
    ", becauw\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk-limiting audits provide a more efficient approach by formulating auditing as a statistical hypothesis test. The null hypothesis is that the reported outcome is wrong.\n",
    "To reject that hypothesis is to conclude that the outcome is correct.\n",
    "Absent strong evidence that the outcome is correct, keep inspecting ballots by hand, possibly proceeding to a full\n",
    "hand tally.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic approaches to risk-limiting election audits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ballot-polling audits. These draw a random sample of ballots but do not rely on the tabulation system at all.\n",
    "2. Comparison audits. This require the voting system to export subtotals (ideally a subtotal for every individual ballot) in such a way that the physical ballots corresponding to the subtotal can be retrieved and the subtotals can be checked manually. It also requires the local election official (LEO) to \"commit\" to the subtotals before the audit starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches require a _ballot manifest_ that describes in detail how the physical ballots are organized and stored (e.g., the number of batches, an identifier for each batch, and the number of ballots in each batch), so that a random sample of ballots can be drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches involve turning the hypothesis \"the reported outcome is wrong\" into a quantitative assertion about\n",
    "a scalar that gives a necessary condition for the outcome to be wrong.\n",
    "For instance, in a _plurality_ contest, the true winner is the candidate (or position) that received the most votes.\n",
    "For the reported winner not to be the true winner, there must be some candidate who received at least as many\n",
    "votes as the reported winner. \n",
    "If we have strong statistical evidence that no candidate received as many votes or more votes than the reported winner, the audit can stop. Otherwise, it continues, potentially to a full hand count.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evidence can be direct (evidence about the fraction of votes for a given candidate), or indirect (evidence\n",
    "that errors in the count are not large enough to alter the outcome). Ballot-polling audits use the first kind of evidence;\n",
    "comparison audits use the second."
